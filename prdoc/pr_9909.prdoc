title: 'pallet-revive: add interface to implement mocks and pranks'

    Needed for: https://github.com/paritytech/foundry-polkadot/pull/334.

    In foundry-polkadot we need the ability to be able to manipulate the `msg.sender` and the `tx.origin` that a solidity contract sees cheatcode documentation, plus the ability to mock calls and functions.

     Currently all create/call methods use the `bare_instantiate`/`bare_call` to run things in pallet-revive,  the caller then normally gets set automatically, based on what is the call stack, but for `forge test` we need to be able to manipulate, so that we can set it to custom values.

    Additionally, for delegate_call, bare_call is used, so there is no way to specify we are dealing with a delegate call, so the call is not working correcly.

    For both this paths, we need a way to inject this information into the execution environment, hence I added an optional hooks interface that we implement from foundry cheatcodes for prank and mock functionality.
