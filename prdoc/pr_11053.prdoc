title: 'tracing-subscriber: Pin version to prevent ANSI colour code issues'
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |-
    Latest version of tracing-subscriber right now doesn't support ASNI colour codes correctly: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3378

    So, the workaround right now is to pin it to `0.3.19`.


    Closes: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/11030
