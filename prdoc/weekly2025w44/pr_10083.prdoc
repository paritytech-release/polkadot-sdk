    Bump jsonrpsee to 0.24.10 so that we can use the request logger with proper trace scopping (see https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/pull/1609) for more details

    this will let us  run the eth-rpc with `jsonrpsee-server=trace` to capture request and responses from the request logger middleware
